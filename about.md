Hello!

# About Me
![My girlfriend and me just before the Summer Ball around the end of our first year at university](../resources/andrewn.co/images/About.png)

I am a first year Computer Science student studying at Royal Holloway,
University of London. My interests and passions include Information Security,
Web Development, Aviation, and without a doubt good food!

[I've written my résumé in markdown](https://github.com/andrewnicolalde/pandoc_resume), forked from [mszep's pandoc_resume.](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume)

# About This Website
This website is hosted using GitHub Pages, and was created using Jekyll, as
countless other websites are. [Its source code is

I'll be adding some more to this section soon, so feel free to check up on it!
