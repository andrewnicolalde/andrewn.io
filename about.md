Hello!

# About Me
![My girlfriend and me infront of Founders Hall at Royal Holloway](../resources/andrewn.co/images/About.jpg)

I am a first year Computer Science student studying at Royal Holloway,
University of London. My interests and passions include Information Security,
Web Development, Aviation, and without a doubt good food!

# About This Website
This website is hosted using GitHub Pages, and was created using Jekyll, as
countless other websites are. Its source code is
available [here.](https://github.com/andrewnicolalde/andrewnicolalde.github.io)

I'll be adding some more to this section soon, so feel free to check up on it!
