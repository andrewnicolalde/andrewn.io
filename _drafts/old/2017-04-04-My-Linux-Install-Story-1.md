title: My Linux Install Story Pt. 1

Hello there!

As this is my first blog entry, I think it's fitting to be about the beginning
of something. Specifically, this post is about how my adventures with Linux
began. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a story about how I installed Linux.

I say installed... more like had Linux installed for me. You see, I have a
friend named [Awen Saunders.](http://AwenS.org) He actually asked me to mention
him by name in this post when I told him I was going to write it, for reasons
soon to become evident. Awen was, hell, still is a more hardcore Linux user than
I am, and he doesn't even run Linux! Perhaps seeking redemption for this guilty
truth, Awen immediately committed to installing Linux on my machine almost as
soon as I had expressed interest in switching to it.

Indeed, not only was Awen going to install Linux on my beautiful laptop, he was
going to install Arch Linux. The distro which needs no introduction. The distro
which has no introduction. The distro which has no introduction because having
an introduction would make it .004% larger and slower, and there's no place for
larger and slower in Archland.

At first I protested. I had wanted to go for a more beginner friendly distro,
but was not completely closed to the idea of jumping in head first the
"hardcore" way as Awen put it. Eventually, I consented. *What could go wrong?* I
thought. *Awen probably knows what he's doing.*

**If I had known what was in store for me, I would be running Windows right now.**
